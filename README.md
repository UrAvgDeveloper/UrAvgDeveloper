- 👋 Hi, I am Aditya Rout, I am a software developer. I love to learn, love to learn by implementation. Restricting myself by being language oriented is not something that I believe in, rather I believe picking up (or learning) a language is easy as long as you have a strong understanding of the roots of software development like planning, logical understanding, high level and low level design.

- 👀 My interest lies in Decentralised Finance, Blockchain development. I have also worked in public EVM based chains like ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and enterprise chains like hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth and R3 corda.

- 🌱 I am an expert in solidity for smart contract development and have also done smart contract auditing.
When it comes to Full stack web development, I have worked in backend technologies like Node.js, Python, Django framework, Golang and Rust. My expertise lies in frontend technologies as well like React.js and Angular.js.

- 💞️ I am on the lookout for freelancing/fullstack opportunities in DeFi, Blockchain development, Frontend and Backend web development.
